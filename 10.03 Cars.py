#create class Car w/ following attributes:
#   year

#   speed
#constructor should accept car's make and year & speed should be set to zero
#methods:
#   accelerate adds value to car's speed
#   brake subtracts value from car's speed (don't go below zero)
#first record in 10.03 Cars.txt file contains year and make
#   instantiate one car object w/ this data
#       if num is greater than zero, call Accelerate
#       if num is less than zero, call Brake
#print change of speed value and current speed
