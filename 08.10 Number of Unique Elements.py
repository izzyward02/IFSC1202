#prompt for a string containing ints separated by spaces
#load values into a list
#find and print elements that appear in list only once (elements must be printed in order in which they occur in original list)
#don't use list or string functions or methods (except .split() method)
#don't use "for x in y" iterator; use "for x in range(n)"
#HINT: loop through each element of list, them loop through list to look for a match
#   don't match element to itself

#EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

#Enter Values Separated by Spaces: 4 3 5 2 5 1 3 5
#Unique Elements: 4 2 1
