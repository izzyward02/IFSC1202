#prompt for a sequence of nums, the last num being zero
#   "Enter a Number (zero to quit): " <-- prompt x amount of times until user inputs 0
#print the average of the nums
#   "Average: " <-- should be a float
#if no data is entered (only a zero was given), generate an error (division by zero)
#   if input is zero, print...
#   "Sequence Length is 0"
