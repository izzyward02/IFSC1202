#prompt for two nums
#   "Enter First Number: " <--represents starting second maximum
#   "Enter Second Number: " <-- represents starting maximum
#prompt for a sequence, last num being zero
#   "Enter a Number (zero to quit): " <-- prompt x amount of times until user inputs 0
#assume that at least two nums will always be entered
#   Hint: each time a new max is found, the old max becomes second max
#print the maximum and second maximum of the sequence
#   "First Maximum: "
#   "Second Maximum: "

#example first num = 1 and second num  = 9
#   presently, second max is 1 and max is 9
#example input sequence is 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 0
#   first max = 10 and second max = 9
