#create function "print_list(a)" where a is a two dimensional list
#   function should print list row by row w/ spaces in between each element
#create function "scale_list(a,s)" that multiplies every value in list by scale factor, where... 
#   a is two dimensional list
#   s is scale factor
#read values in file "09.03 NumbersList.txt" into two dimensional array
#print list by calling print_list(a)
#prompt for scale factor
#multiply every value in list by scale factor using function scaled_list(a,s)
#print scaled list by calling print_list(a)

#EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

#11 12 
#21 22 23 
#31 32 33 34 
#Enter scale value: 2
#22 24 
#42 44 46 
#62 64 66 68
