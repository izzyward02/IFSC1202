#prime num is a natural num greater than 1 w/ no positive divisors other than 1 and itself\
#given two ints A & B, print all prime nums between them, inclusively
#hint: copy code from 04.08 & modify so that 'n' varies from A to B
#   "Enter A: "
#   "Enter B: "
#example inputs of A = 2 and B = 10 generates...
#   2
#   3
#   5
