#prompt for a sequence of nums, last num being zero
#   "Enter a Number (zero to quit): " <-- prompt x amount of times until user inputs 0
#print largest value & index of largest value in the sequence
#   "Maximum: "
#   "Index of Maximum: "
#if no nums are entered (only zero is given), then both max and index should generate to 0
