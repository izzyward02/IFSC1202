#prompt for a string containing ints separated by spaces
#load values into a list
#find and print the first adjacent elements with the same sign
#if there isn't a pair, leave output blank
#don't use list or string functions or methods (except .split() method)
#don't use the "for x in y" iterator; use "for x in range(n)"

#EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

#Enter Values Separated by Spaces: -1 2 3 -1 -2
#2 3
#-1 -2
