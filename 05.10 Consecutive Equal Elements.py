#prompt for a sequence of nums, last being zero
#   "Enter a Number (zero to quit): " <-- prompt x amount of times until user inputs 0
#print the max number of consecutive equal elements
#   "n repeated k times"
#if two values repeat the same num of times, display the first recorded duplicates

#example sequence of 1, 7, 7, 9, 1, 0
#   "7 repeated 2 times"    <--didn't print 1 b/c the two instances were not consecutive
