#Fibonacci sequence is the sum of previous two nums in a sequence
#   sequence always begins with 0 & 1
#   first ten nums in the sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55...n 
#   i.e., if you're finding the 5th number, it is 3rd + 4th in sequence
#prompt for an index in the sequence
#   "Enter Fibonacci Sequence Number: "
#display the 'n'th Fibonacci number associated w/ given index
#   "Fibonacci Number: "

#example input of sequence index 7 generates Fibonacci number of 13
#example input of sequence index 10 generates Fibonacci number of 55
