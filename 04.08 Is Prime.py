#prime num is a natural num greater than 1 w/ no positive divisors other than 1 and itself
#given int n>1, print PRIME if 'n' is prime and COMPOSITE otherwise
#hint: loop from 2 to (half of N) + 1 & check if any num evenly divides into N
#   "Enter N: "
#example input of N = 4 generates COMPOSITE
#example input of N = 5 generates PRIME
